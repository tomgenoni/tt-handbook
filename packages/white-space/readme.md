# White Space

Control how text wraps.

* `nowrap`: Sequences of whitespace will collapse into a single whitespace. Text will never wrap to the next line. The text continues on the same line until a `<br>` tag is encountered.
* `pre`: Whitespace is preserved by the browser. Text will only wrap on line breaks. Acts like the `<pre>` tag in HTML.
